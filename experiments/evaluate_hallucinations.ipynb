      "A: starting with an obligation on the statutory auditor or audit firm to express an opinion about the compliance of the sustainability reporting with union requirements based on a limited assurance engagement\n",
      "C: therefore, a progressive approach to enhancing the level of the assurance required for sustainability information should be considered, starting with an obligation on the statutory auditor or audit firm to express an opinion about the compliance of the sustainability reporting with union requirements based on a limited assurance engagement. that opinion should cover the compliance of the sustainability reporting with union sustainability reporting standards, the process carried out by the undertaking to identify the information reported pursuant to the sustainability reporting standards and compliance with the requirement to mark up sustainability reporting. the auditor should also assess whether the undertaking’s reporting complies with the reporting requirements of article 8 of regulation (eu) 2020/ to ensure a common understanding and common expectations of what a reasonable assurance engagement would consist of, the statutory auditor or audit firm should be required to express an opinion based on a reasonable assurance engagement about the compliance of the sustainability reporting with union requirements, when the commission adopts assurance standards for reasonable assurance of sustainability reporting by means of delegated acts no later than 1 october 2028, following an assessment to determine if reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and undertakings. the statutory auditor or the audit firm shall document at least the data recorded pursuant to article 22b as regards the assurance of sustainability reporting. the statutory auditor or the audit firm shall retain any other data and documents that are of importance in support of the assurance report on sustainability reporting referred to in article 28a and for monitoring compliance with this directive and other applicable legal requirements as regards the assurance of sustainability reporting. the assurance file shall be closed no later than 60 days after the date of signature of the assurance report on sustainability reporting referred to in article 28a. where the same statutory auditor carries out the statutory audit of annual financial statements and the assurance of sustainability reporting, the assurance file may be included in the audit file.’; (e) paragraph 6 is replaced by the following: ‘the statutory auditor or the audit firm shall keep records of any complaints made in writing about the performance of the statutory audits carried out and about the performance of assurance engagements concerning sustainability reporting carried out.’; statutory auditors or audit firms already verify the financial statements and the management report. the assurance of sustainability reporting by the statutory auditors or audit firms would help to ensure the connectivity between, and consistency of, financial and sustainability information, which is particularly important for users of sustainability information. however, there is a risk of further concentration of the audit market, which could risk the independence of auditors and increase audit fees or fees relating to the assurance of sustainability reporting. considering the key role of statutory auditors when providing assurance of sustainability reporting and ensuring reliable sustainability information, the commission has announced that it will act to further enhance audit quality and to create a more open and diversified audit market, which are the conditions for the successful application of this amending directive. in addition, it is desirable to offer undertakings a broader choice of independent assurance services providers for the assurance of sustainably reporting. member states should therefore be allowed to accredit independent assurance services providers in accordance with regulation (ec) no 765/2008 of the european parliament and of the council to provide an assurance opinion on sustainability reporting, which should be published together with the management report. in addition, member states should be given the option of allowing\n"

      "C: producer responsibility management at stage. accordingly, they should finance the costs of collecting, treating and recycling all collected batteries, carrying out compositional surveys of mixed collected municipal waste, reporting on batteries and waste batteries, and of providing information to end-users and waste operators about batteries and appropriate re-use and management of waste batteries. the new rules on extended producer responsibility under this regulation are intended to ensure a high level of environmental and health protection in the union by maximising separate collection of waste batteries and ensuring that all collected batteries are recycled through processes that reach high rates of recycling efficiency and recovery of materials in light of technical and scientific progress. the obligations related to extended producer responsibility should apply to all forms of supply, including distance selling. producers should be able to exercise those obligations collectively, by means of producer responsibility organisations taking responsibility on their behalf. producers or producer responsibility organisations should be subject to authorisation and they should demonstrate that they have the financial means to cover the costs entailed by the extended producer responsibility. when laying down administrative and procedural rules for authorisation of producers for individual compliance and of producer responsibility organisations for collective compliance, member states should be able to differentiate processes for individual producers and producer responsibility organisations to limit the administrative burden on individual producers. in this context, it should be possible to consider permits issued in accordance with directive 2008/98/ec to be an authorisation for the purposes of this regulation. where necessary to avoid distortion of the internal market and in order to ensure uniform conditions for the modulation of the financial contributions paid to producer responsibility organisations by (106) producers should be responsible for financing and organising the separate collection of waste batteries. they should do so by establishing a take-back and collection network and related information campaigns that cover the whole territory of each member state. such networks should be close to the end-user and should not only target areas and batteries where collection of waste batteries is profitable. the collection network should include distributors, authorised treatment facilities for waste electrical and electronic equipment and end-of-life vehicles and civic amenity sites, and, on a voluntary basis other actors, such as public authorities and schools. in order to verify and improve the effectiveness of the collection network and related information campaigns, regular compositional surveys at least at nuts 2 level, which is provided for in regulation (ec) no 1059/2003 of the european parliament and of the council (?°) should be carried out on mixed municipal waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment collected to determine the amount of waste portable batteries therein. harmonised rules for waste management are necessary to ensure that producers and other economic operators are subject to the same rules across the member states in the implementation of the extended producer responsibility for batteries and to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment across the union. extended producer responsibility can contribute to reducing overall resource use, in particular by reducing the generation of waste batteries and the adverse impacts linked to the management of waste batteries. maximising the separate collection of waste batteries and ensuring that all waste batteries that are collected are recycled through processes that meet common minimum recycling efficiencies is necessary in order to attain high levels of recovery of materials. in its evaluation of directive 2006/66/ec, the commission found that one of the shortcomings of that directive is that its provisions were insufficiently detailed, leading to uneven implementation and creating significant barriers to the functioning of recycling markets and suboptimal levels of recycling. consequently, more detailed and harmonised rules would avoid distortions of the market for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries and ensure even implementation of the requirements across the union. it would also result in further harmonisation of the quality of waste management services provided by economic operators and facilitate the functioning of the market for secondary raw materials\n"
