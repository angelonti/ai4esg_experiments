In cases where an enterprise has structured a direct supplier relationship in an improper manner or has engaged in a transaction in order to circumvent the due diligence obligations with regard to the direct supplier, an indirect supplier is deemed to be a direct supplier.\n",

      "(3) The enterprise must ensure that the results of the risk analysis are communicated internally to the relevant decision-makers, such as the board of directors or the purchasing department.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) The risk analysis must be carried out once a year as well as on an ad hoc basis if the enterprise must expect a significantly changed or significantly expanded risk situation in the supply chain, for example due to the introduction of new products, projects or a new business field.

      "undertakings themselves stand to benefit from carrying out high-quality reporting on sustainability matters. the growth in the number of investment products that aim to pursue sustainability objectives means that good sustainability reporting can enhance an undertaking’s access to financial capital. sustainability reporting can help undertakings to identify and manage their own risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters. it can provide a basis for better dialogue and communication between undertakings and their stakeholders, and can help undertakings to improve their reputation. moreover, a consistent basis for sustainability reporting in the form of sustainability reporting standards would lead to relevant and sufficient information being provided and thus significantly decrease ad hoc requests for information. the commission report of 21 april 2021 on the review clauses in directives 2013/34/eu, 2014/95/eu, and 2013/50/eu and its accompanying fitness check on the eu framework for public reporting by companies (‘commission report on the review clauses and its accompanying fitness check’) identified problems as to the effectiveness of directive 2014/95/eu. there is significant evidence that many undertakings do not disclose material information on all major sustainability-related topics, including climate-related information such as all ghg emissions, and factors that affect biodiversity. the report also identified the limited comparability and reliability of sustainability information as significant problems. additionally, many undertakings from which users need sustainability information are not obliged to report such information. accordingly, there is a clear need for a robust and affordable reporting framework that is accompanied by effective auditing practices to ensure the reliability of data and avoid greenwashing and double counting. in the absence of policy action, the gap between users’ information needs and the sustainability information provided by undertakings is expected to grow. that gap has significant negative consequences. investors are unable to take sufficient account of sustainability-related risks and opportunities in their investment decisions. the aggregation of multiple investment decisions that do not take adequate account of sustainability-related risks has the potential to create systemic risks that threaten financial stability. the european central bank (ecb) and international organisations, such as the financial stability board, have drawn attention to those systemic risks, in particular as regards climate. investors are also less able to channel financial resources to undertakings and economic activities that address and do not exacerbate social and environmental problems, which undermines the objectives of the green deal, the action plan on financing sustainable growth and the paris agreement. non- governmental organisations, social partners, communities affected by undertakings’ activities, and other stakeholders are less able to hold undertakings accountable for their impacts on people and the environment. this creates an accountability deficit and could lead to lower levels of citizen trust in businesses, which in turn could have negative impacts on the efficient functioning of the social market economy. the lack of generally accepted metrics and methods for measuring, valuing, and managing sustainability-related risks is also an obstacle to the efforts of undertakings to ensure that their business models and activities are sustainable. the lack of sustainability information provided by undertakings also limits the ability of stakeholders, including civil society actors, trade unions and workers’ representatives, to enter into dialogue with undertakings on sustainability matters. the commission report on the review clauses and its accompanying fitness check also identified a significant increase in requests to undertakings for information about sustainability matters aimed at addressing the existing information gap between users’ information needs and the available corporate sustainability information. in addition, ongoing expectations on undertakings to use a variety of different frameworks and standards are likely to continue and may even intensify as the value placed on sustainability information continues to grow. in the absence of policy action to build consensus on the information that undertakings should report, there will be significant increases in terms of cost and burden for reporting undertakings and for users of such information. the existing information gap makes it more likely that individual member states will introduce increasingly divergent national rules or standards. different reporting requirements in different member states could create additional costs and complexity for undertakings operating across borders and therefore undermine the internal market, and could undermine the right of establishment and the free movement of capital across the union. such different reporting requirements could also make reported less comparable across borders, undermining the capital markets union.\n",
